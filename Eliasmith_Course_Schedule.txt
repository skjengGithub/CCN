Assignment details
The assignments above mirror those in the book. It is also useful to ask questions about the functioning of the models being built, 
and to ask students to change the models slightly to examine different aspects of neural/cognitive processing.
The intent of this section of the website is to provide examples of such questions, as we develop them. Suggestions welcome.

Suggested projects
More suggestions welcome.

Build a serial working memory model that allows for loading, reset, etc.
Build a robot controller for a robot that you present instructions to, that it memorizes and then executes.
Build an adaptive controller for a 3-link arm using Slotine's adaptation methods.
Build a model that does any one of the tasks in Spaun.
